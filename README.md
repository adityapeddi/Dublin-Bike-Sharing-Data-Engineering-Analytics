# Dublin Bike Sharing – Data Engineering & Analytics Case Study
## Dublin Bike Sharing Data Engineering & Analytics

### 🎯 Business Problem
This project explores historical Dublin Bikes station availability data to uncover temporal patterns, usage trends, and insights that can help planners and operators make data-informed decisions about bike distribution and service levels.

### 📊 Data Sources
- Historical Dublin Bikes dataset containing station availability snapshots over time (CSV/JSON files).

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, request)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualisation

### 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Irregular time series requiring careful cleaning and alignment
- Handling missing or noisy data
- Designing meaningful time-based features

### 🧠 Engineering Approach
1. Loaded and cleaned raw data
2. Extracted useful time features
3. Conducted exploratory trend analysis
4. Visualised patterns and interpreted results

### 📈 Key Insights
- Peak demand occurs during specific hours corresponding to commute times
- Usage patterns differ significantly between weekdays and weekends
- Certain stations show consistently higher volatility in bike availability

### 💡 Impact — What decisions could be taken?
- Plan bike rebalancing schedules based on usage peaks
- Allocate maintenance and operational resources more effectively
- Improve service reliability and user satisfaction
